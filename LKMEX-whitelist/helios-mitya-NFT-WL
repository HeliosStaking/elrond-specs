Description of the project: 

Helios Staking created the Mitya NFT for its delegators. Anyone who had at least 1 EGLD staked with Helios Staking as of 03/22/22 was given the opportunity to mint 1 NFT for free. The total amount of delegators was 5254, so the collection was created with 5254 unique 
NFTs. The NFTs that were not claimed were then sold, and the proceeds were used to farm rewards. All secondary market sales royalties are added to the base amount being farmed.  LKMEX earned from farming is distributed monthly to all holders from wallet address

Royalities are added to farms to incease the rewards that are done every 41 days. LKMEX is one of these and we use a python script from the address below to distribute.
